9) What are the benefits of data field encapsulation?
   ->Hiding data: Users will have no idea how classes are being implemented or stored.
     More flexibility: Enables you to set variables as read or write-only.
     Easy to reuse: With encapsulation, it's easy to change and adapt to new requirements.


10) public class Test {
                  private int id;

                 public Test (int id)   -> -> should implement the constructor 
                  {
                     this.id = id;
                  }                      



                  public void m1() {  
                      this.id = 45;
                                   }
                  public static void m2() {      -> should be static method because the calling through the class
                     Test.id = 45;
                                   }

                       }
